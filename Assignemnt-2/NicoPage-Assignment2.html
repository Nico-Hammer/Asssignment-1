                <h2 id="H1">The Platypus</h2>
                <p>The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed playpus, is one of few mammals on earth that lays eggs (known as monotremes)
                    and is the sole living representative of its family and genus Ornithorhynchus.
                </p>
                <h2 id="H2">Physical Characteristics</h2>
                <p>Described as a "duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal", the platypus is one of the most unique looking animals on the planet. Apart from its unusual appearance,
                    it also has incredibly soft fur and was hunted for it during the past, but it has been a protected species since 1912.
                </p>
                <h2 id="H3">Habitat and Distribution</h2>
                <p>Being a semi-aquatic species, platypus prefer areas with abundant water. They occupy small streams and rivers over an extensive area from the highlands of Tasmania
                    and the Australian Alps, to the tropical rainforests of coastal Queensland as far north as the Cape York Pennisula. Male territories often occupy up to 7km (4.3 mi) of land
                    and border on 3 to 4 female territories, included in the territories are riparian zones where they have the opportunity to create nests/burrows and rest to digest food.
                </p>
                <h2 id="H4">Diet</h2>
                <p>Platypus are carnivorous and hunts by using electrolocation, which uses specialized receptors in its bill to send out electrical signals in the water, allowing it to hunt
                    even in cloudy water. They prey on annelid worms, insect larvae, freshwater shrimp, and crayfish which it digs out of the sand with its bill or catches while swimming.
                    They carry prey to the surface by holding them in its cheek-pouches and eats around 20% of its weight per day requiring it spend up to 12 hours a day hunting.
                </p>
                <h2 id="H5">Reproduction and Lifespan</h2>
                <p>While some local variations exist, for the most part there is a single mating season per year between June and October. Platypus mate using a polygynous system meaning
                    both male and female mate with multiple partners however males typically have more partners than the females. After mating, the females lay between one and three roud,
                    leathery eggs (on average they lay two) which develop in utero for 28 days and with 10 days of external incubation. They can live up to 30 years in captivity and have
                    reported cases of living up 24 years old in the wild.
                </p>
