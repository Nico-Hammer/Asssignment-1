            <h1>Southern Giraffe</h1>
            <p>The Southern giraffe <em>(Giraffa giraffa)</em> is a majestic herbivore native to the savannas and open woodlands of Southern Africa. Recognized for its distinctive, towering stature, it can reach heights of up to 18 feet, making it the tallest land animal on Earth. Its coat features a unique pattern of irregular, star-shaped patches that vary in color from light brown to reddish-brown, providing excellent camouflage in its natural habitat. Southern giraffes primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers, favoring acacia trees.</p>

        <h1>The Giraffe </h1>
        <p>
            The giraffe <em>(Giraffa camelopardalis)</em> is the tallest land mammal on Earth, native to sub <span>Saharan Africa.</span>
            Known for its extremely long neck and legs, the giraffe stands out in the animal kingdom with a height that 
            can reach up to 5.7 meters (18.7 feet) for males and 5.2 meters (17 feet) for females. It belongs to the family 
            Giraffidae, which it shares with only one other species—the okapi.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="physical-characteristics">
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>The giraffe’s most iconic feature is its neck, which can be up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) long. Despite its length, the giraffe has only seven cervical vertebrae—the same number as most mammals, including humans. Each vertebra is elongated to accommodate the giraffe’s height.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are found in various regions across sub-Saharan Africa, inhabiting savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. They tend to favor areas with an abundance of acacia trees, which provide a large portion of their diet.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="social-structure">
        <h2>Social Structure</h2>
        <p>Giraffes are social animals, often seen in loose groups called "towers." These groups can consist of both males and females, but males are known to be more solitary. Giraffes exhibit a unique form of social interaction, including necking behavior, where males engage in combat using their necks to establish dominance and mating rights.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="reproduction">
        <h2>Reproduction and Lifespan</h2>
        <p>The gestation period for giraffes is about 15 months, after which a single calf is born. Calves are able to stand and walk within a few hours of birth, quickly learning to navigate their surroundings. Giraffes can live up to 25 years in the wild and even longer in captivity.</p>
